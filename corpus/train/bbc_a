Bayern [OST] Munich [OED] cemented [FRN] their [FRN] status [FRN] as [FRN]
the [FRN] growing [FRN] power [FRN] in [FRN] European [LUQ] football [FRN]
by [FRN] ruthlessly [FRN] dismantling [FRN] favourites [FRN] Barcelona [OUQ]
in [FRN] the [FRN] Champions [OST] League [OED] semi-final [FRN] first [FRN]
leg [FRN]
------
Barca [OUQ] coach [FRN] Tito [PST] Vilanova [PED] gambled [FRN] and [FRN]
lost [FRN] on [FRN] a [FRN] clearly [FRN] unfit [FRN] Lionel [PST] Messi [PED]
but [FRN] to [FRN] suggest [FRN] this [FRN] was [FRN] the [FRN] prime [FRN]
factor [FRN] behind [FRN] this [FRN] crushing [FRN] loss [FRN] is [FRN]
to [FRN] do [FRN] a [FRN] grave [FRN] disservice [FRN] to [FRN] Bayern [OUQ]
------
Former [FRN] Chelsea [OUQ] winger [FRN] Arjen [PST] Robben [PED] tormented [FRN]
a [FRN] desperately [FRN] vulnerable [FRN] Barcelona [OUQ] defence [FRN]
adding [FRN] a [FRN] third [FRN] before [FRN] Mueller [OUQ] got [FRN] his [FRN]
second [FRN] near [FRN] the [FRN] end [FRN] to [FRN] surely [FRN] put [FRN]
this [FRN] tie [FRN] out [FRN] of [FRN] even [FRN] Barcelona's [OUQ] reach [FRN]
------
Messi [PUQ] was [FRN] declared [FRN] fit [FRN] to [FRN] play [FRN] and [FRN]
started [FRN] for [FRN] Barcelona [OUQ] despite [FRN] concerns [FRN] about [FRN]
the [FRN] hamstring [FRN] injury [FRN] he [FRN] sustained [FRN] in [FRN] the [FRN]
previous [FRN] round [FRN] against [FRN] Paris [PST] St [PMD] Germain [PED]
------
He [FRN] looked [FRN] a [FRN] long [FRN] way [FRN] from [FRN] his [FRN] usual [FRN]
brilliance [FRN] but [FRN] he [FRN] was [FRN] not [FRN] alone [FRN] as [FRN]
buoyant [FRN] Bayern [OUQ] took [FRN] control [FRN] of [FRN] proceedings [FRN]
------
The [FRN] opening [FRN] goal [FRN] had [FRN] been [FRN] coming [FRN] and [FRN] it [FRN]
duly [FRN] arrived [FRN] after [FRN] 25 [FRN] minutes [FRN]
------
Dante's [OUQ] header [FRN] from [FRN] Robben's [OUQ] cross [FRN] was [FRN] off [FRN]
target [FRN] but [FRN] the [FRN] opportunist [FRN] Muller [PUQ] arrived [FRN] at [FRN]
the [FRN] far [FRN] post [FRN] to [FRN] score [FRN] despite [FRN] Valdes [PUQ]
making [FRN] good [FRN] contact [FRN]
------
Barcelona's [OUQ] agony [FRN] was [FRN] not [FRN] over [FRN] yet [FRN] as [FRN]
Mueller [PUQ] applied [FRN] another [FRN] of [FRN] those [FRN] trademark [FRN]
close-range [FRN] finishes [FRN] from [FRN] David [PST] Alaba's [PED] cross [FRN]
to [FRN] give [FRN] Bayern [OUQ] an [FRN] advantage [FRN] of [FRN] such [FRN]
command [FRN] it [FRN] is [FRN] difficult [FRN] to [FRN] see [FRN] how [FRN]
it [FRN] can [FRN] be [FRN] retrieved [FRN]
------
Blackburn [OUQ] took [FRN] a [FRN] huge [FRN] step [FRN] towards [FRN] Championship [OUQ]
safety [FRN] as [FRN] Jordan [PST] Rhodes' [PED] late [FRN] penalty [FRN] defeated [FRN]
Millwall [OUQ]
------
Lions [OUQ] boss [FRN] Kenny [PST] Jackett [PED] saw [FRN] his [FRN] side [FRN] take [FRN]
the [FRN] lead [FRN] when [FRN] former [FRN] Brentford [OUQ] player [FRN] Osborne [PUQ]
fired [FRN] home [FRN] from [FRN] seven [FRN] yards [FRN] his [FRN] first [FRN] goal [FRN]
for [FRN] the [FRN] club [FRN]
------
Although [FRN] Rhodes [PUQ] sent [FRN] Forde [PUQ] the [FRN] wrong [FRN] way[FRN] Millwall [OUQ]
missed [FRN] a [FRN] great [FRN] chance [FRN] to [FRN] equalise [FRN] when [FRN] Osborne [PUQ]
was [FRN] denied [FRN] a [FRN] second [FRN] goal [FRN] by [FRN] goalkeeper [FRN] Grzegorz [PST]
Sandomierski [PED]
------
Bayern [OST] Munich [OED] coach [FRN] Jupp [PST] Heynckes [PED] insisted [FRN] he [FRN] was [FRN]
not [FRN] surprised [FRN] by [FRN] their [FRN] performance [FRN] as [FRN] they [FRN] thrashed [FRN]
Barcelona [OUQ] in [FRN] the [FRN] Champions [OST] League [OED]
------
Barcelona [OUQ] may [FRN] have [FRN] had [FRN] possession [FRN] but [FRN] were [FRN] subdued [FRN]
as [FRN] Bayern [OUQ] restricted [FRN] them [FRN] to [FRN] only [FRN] four [FRN] attempts [FRN]
on [FRN] goal [FRN] all [FRN] night [FRN]
------
And [FRN] it [FRN] was [FRN] Bayern [OUQ] who [FRN] were [FRN] utterly [FRN] dominant [FRN] in [FRN]
front [FRN] of [FRN] their [FRN] own [FRN] fans [FRN] cruising [FRN] to [FRN] a [FRN] deserved [FRN]
win [FRN] with [FRN] two [FRN] goals [FRN] from [FRN] Thomas [PST] Mueller [PED] added [FRN] to [FRN]
by [FRN] Mario [PST] Gomez [PED] and [FRN] Arjen [PST] Robben [PED]
------
Barcelona's [OUQ] chances [FRN] of [FRN] reaching [FRN] the [FRN] final [FRN] look [FRN] slim [FRN]
------
But [FRN] still [FRN] Heynckes [PUQ] refused [FRN] to [FRN] say [FRN] the [FRN] mauling [FRN] is [FRN] the [FRN]
end [FRN] of [FRN] an [FRN] era [FRN] for [FRN] the [FRN] great [FRN] Catalan [LUQ] side [FRN]

Brussia [OST] Dortmund [OED] coach [FRN] Jurgen [PST] Klopp [PED] has [FRN] told [FRN] supporters [FRN]
to [FRN] leave [FRN] their [FRN] negative [FRN] thoughts [FRN] at [FRN] home [FRN]

were [FRN] Real [OST] Madrid [OED] with [FRN] the [FRN] Spaniards [LUQ] winning [FRN] 2-0 [FRN] on [FRN]
aggregate [FRN] before [FRN] going [FRN] on [FRN] to [FRN] win [FRN] the [FRN] title [FRN]
------
We [FRN] then [FRN] went [FRN] to [FRN] Madrid [LUQ] and [FRN] played [FRN]
one [FRN] of [FRN] our [FRN] greatest [FRN] ever [FRN] performances. [FRN]
------
We [FRN] have [FRN] a [FRN] lot [FRN] of [FRN] respect [FRN] for [FRN]
Real [OUQ] but [FRN] we [FRN] have [FRN] already [FRN] shown [FRN]
what [FRN] quality [FRN] we [FRN] have [FRN] in [FRN] the [FRN]
team [FRN] and [FRN] we [FRN] want [FRN] to [FRN] show [FRN] it [FRN]
again [FRN]
